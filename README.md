Causality-redux is an extension to redux that significantly reduces redux and react-redux coding and debugging.

## Benefits of causality-redux
- You can define multiple partitions within the redux store. This way, one partition can be associated exclusively with a causality chain of a UI component and its business logic. This also allows you to have shared partitions that can be used to change the state of such things as a UI busy loader than can be shared by different causality chains.
- To implement causality, causality-redux exposes two main concepts, changers which initiate a cause and subscribers that subscribe as an effect to the cause. The programming steps taken by the subscriber as a result of the cause is the effect.
- Specific keys within a partition can be targeted by a subscriber of state changes. So, the subscriber is not called unless one of the targets is changed.
- The subscriber is called with the targeted keys/values that changed as an argument so that it does not need to call getState to figure out if the state changes apply to the subscriber.
- In most cases changers/dispatchers do not need to be defined or coded. They are automatically generated by causality-redux.
- In most cases reducers do not need to be defined or coded. They are automatically generated by causality-redux.           
- Type checking of arguments is performed for most changers in order to catch coding errors early.
- Connecting changers and partition values to react components takes only one line of code. mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps definitions are no longer needed.
- React PropType definitions are not needed unless they represent component configurations because causality-redux does all of the type checking of arguments and automatically validates functions that are set to props in react components.
- Business logic functions do not need to be passed down the react UI tree as props. A react component simply binds to a changer string name that causes a state change in which business logic subscribes to the change and implements the causality chain. So a react component can be a fully functional business logic/UI unit without any dependencies on the containing react UI tree.
- UI components do not need to import business logic functions or reference them since the components bind to changer string names instead of business functions. So, neither the business logic nor the UI components need to import anything about the other.
- Allows hot re-loading of business code for easier debugging.
- Provides middleware between business code and UI such as react or another other UI implementation. UI implementations come and go and with causality-redux you do not have to tear out your business code from the UI. There is a clean separation between the two with no importing needed from each other. So, if the UI implementation changes in the future, you only need to worry about the UI.
- Causality-redux is very small only 4K gzipped.
